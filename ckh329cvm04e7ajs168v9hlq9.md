## Why i choose HashNode over WordPress ?

You guys might be wondering why I preferred [Hashnode] as my blogging platform over [WordPress], despite being a hardcore [WordPress] developer.




## Why ?
I choose [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com) because of below reasons.

1. Its cloud hosted & Free of cost
2. Supports Markdown which i am more familiar with
3. Built in social share
4. Lightweight & Faster

Even tho **WordPress** offers Hosted service for free via [WordPress.com],
and the rest of the feature that i mentioned above can be added to **WordPress** using some plugins, but that never going to make the site lightweight & faster. 

In the early days [WordPress] was actually known to run personal blog and itself had a tagline `"Blog  Platform"` . currently [WordPress] seems to be a platform where any kind of website can be created using [WordPress] itself as base.

<blockquote> This doesn't mean i hate wordpress.  </blockquote>

> i still ❤️ to use [WordPress] & will be developing plugins for it.

## What i love about Hashnode ?

I love many things about [Hashnode]. it offers everything built & reduces the time it takes to setup a personal blog site

I mainly like the support for **Markdown** Editor. as a open source developer who mainly works a lot in [GitHub] repositories and writing `README.md`, `wiki` using **Markdown**. using the same [Hashnode] will make things even more *easier*.
